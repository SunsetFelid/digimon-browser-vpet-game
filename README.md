# digimon-browser-vpet-game
-Started Dec 2 from 2:30PM - 6PM
-Worked on index.html file, set up styles.css & app.js, commented with a guideline on what I wanted to do (make a Digimon version of Neopets)
-Worked Monday Dec 4 from 7:30PM - 9:00PM on code for account creation, login submission form, and the constructor classes for users and Digimon
-Worked convinced Wednesday Dec 6 to reduce scope & deleted any files and code regarding account creation and login, added code for Digimon's death (7:30PM - 7:48PM)
-Worked Friday Dec 8 on fixing up the index.html to align with the new scope. Blurred the background image (for copyright reasons) and created UI for the actual game part of the page.
-Added some art I had made in 2020 to act as the background for the part of the screen the digimon would be allowed to exist in. Started working on code that decides if a Digiegg is generated,
  as only one Digimon should be in existence at a time.
